# Netlify Configuration File
# This file configures how Netlify builds and deploys your portfolio site

[build]
  # Base directory - where your site files are located
  base = "portfolio"
  
  # Publish directory - relative to base directory (current directory after setting base)
  publish = "."
  
  # Build command (optional - only needed if you have a build process)
  # command = "npm run build"
  
  # Note: No Node.js version specified - static site doesn't need it
  # If you add Netlify Functions later, uncomment and set NODE_VERSION below:
  # [build.environment]
  #   NODE_VERSION = "18"

# Redirect rules - handle routing for your site
[[redirects]]
  # Redirect root to main portfolio page
  from = "/"
  to = "/photography-index.html"
  status = 200

# Additional redirect for clean URLs (optional)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/home"
  to = "/photography-index.html"
  status = 200

# Note: Netlify automatically uses 404.html for 404 errors
# No need for explicit redirect - Netlify handles it automatically
