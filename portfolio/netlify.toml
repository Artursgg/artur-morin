# Netlify Configuration File
# This file configures how Netlify builds and deploys your portfolio site

[build]
  # Publish directory - where your built site files are located
  publish = "."
  
  # Build command (optional - only needed if you have a build process)
  # command = "npm run build"

# [build.environment]
  # Node.js version for Netlify Functions (if you add serverless functions later)
  # NODE_VERSION = "18.17.0"
  # Commented out - static site doesn't need Node.js

# Redirect rules - handle routing for your site
[[redirects]]
  # Redirect root to main portfolio page
  from = "/"
  to = "/photography-index.html"
  status = 200

# Additional redirect for clean URLs (optional)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/home"
  to = "/photography-index.html"
  status = 200

# Note: Netlify automatically uses 404.html for 404 errors
# The 404.html file in the publish directory will be used automatically
# No redirect needed - Netlify handles 404s natively
